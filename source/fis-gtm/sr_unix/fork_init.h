/* This macro takes care of safely clearing the timer queue and resetting the timer-related globals when we need
 * to fork-off a process. Note that it is necessary to use this macro EVEN WHEN the fork is immediately followed
 * by an exec (of any flavor), because of the ENABLE_INTERRUPTS macro usage right after the "fork" call.
 * If this call is done in the child process (0 == pid), and timer variables are not cleared, it is possible
 * (if the right conditions are met) that "have_crit" gets invoked as part of the ENABLE_INTERRUPTS macro in
 * the child process and ends up with a GTMASSERT -- BYPASSOK -- (GTM-8050). If timers have not been initialized at all,
 * then "clear_timers" does no system calls so the only overhead is a function call invocation which is okay considering
 * we anyways have invoked the "fork()" system call just now.
